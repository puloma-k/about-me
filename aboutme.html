            <div class="text">
                I will be a senior at American High School in the fall, a title that is accompanied by the strenuous process of completing college applications. Being an only child, I enjoy spending time with my parents and we often go to restaurants or hiking in the numerous regional parks scattered around the Bay Area. The opportunities to play video games and listen to music are few and far between, especially with the strain of homework, but I enjoy them when they do present themselves.

            <em>Likes:</em>
            I love hiking and other outdoor activities, like camping. This usually leads to stargazing, given my passion for astronomy.

                <em>Dislikes:</em>
                Slow walkers. They're everywhere: school hallways, crowded sidewalks, bustling malls.
